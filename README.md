# God-Hand-Extraction-Tools
GHET tools is a tool created to extract God Hand .DAT models, textures, animations &amp; etc


this tool was created for learning purposes, yet, god hand is a good game, in order to increase it's popularity, let's make it extractable, what could go wrong?

*IT'S ON INITIAL STAGES*
only .md models can be extracted from the .dat files, but, you already can convert the .md with the god hand quickBMS script: http://www.mediafire.com/file/jpwig1k5wm2869h/Quickbms_script_for_God_Hand.zip/file
there are two scripts in the folder.... the "god_hand_mdto3ds" is the one that can convert the .md models to a readable model format, and in order to get this working
you should download quickbms:

it's a model extractor, it works with a TXT script, which is the one shown above
